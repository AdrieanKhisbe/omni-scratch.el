*Omni-scratch.el*

/More details to come/

* Description

The goal of this basic mode is to easily create scratch buffer to edit in the curreny major mode you are using.
Some features like custom scratch buffer with specific minor-modes, copy on quit, etc, might be added over time.

* Installation

To install it, put the files in your load path, and require it.
Otherwise, if you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] you could use the following config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package omni-scratch
    :bind (("M-s DEL". new-scratch-buffer)
           ("M-s <deletechar>". new-scratch-major-buffer)))
#+end_src

Wait it to mature a bit and maybe you might get =some el-get= recipe, before it hits elpa, melpa, quelpa or else.

* Usage

Fonctionalities are limited for now:
- you can create a scratch buffer with the current mode you are using =new-scratch-major-buffer=
- you can create a new scratch buffer with =new-scratch-buffer=

* Notes

This is still a prototype. So if ever you think about using it, prefer the =master= branch, and expect to update your config.
Name of function and even behavior might change, so don't be suprised

It's working, I use it on my =Emacs=, but it's far wrong being perfect and not yet stable.
(Cask config to be improved, test to be done, etc)

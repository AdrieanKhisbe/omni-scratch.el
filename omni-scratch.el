;;; Commentary:

;; Easily create scratch buffer to edit in the curreny major mode you are using.
;; Some features like custom scratch buffer with specific minor-modes,
;; copy on quit, etc, might be added over time.

;;; Building-Notes:

;; §todo: switch to THE buffer associated with current programming mode.
;; §maybe: integration with popwin.

;;; Code:

(defvar omni-scratch-latest-scratch-buffer (get-buffer "*scratch*")
  "The Latest scratch buffer used.")

(defvar omni-scratch-origin-buffer nil
  "The last normal buffer from which command was invoked")

(defun omni-scratch-create-scratch-buffer (name mode)
  "Create or switch to NAME buffer in specified MODE."
  ;; §later: option noselect?
  ;; §maybe: create or also switch to?
  ;; §TODO: rename?, kill interactive?
  (let ((buffer (get-buffer-create name) ))
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)
    (setq omni-scratch-latest-scratch-buffer buffer)
    (funcall mode)

    ;; [and var: maybe identify the scratch buffer]: local var and register in alist or so
